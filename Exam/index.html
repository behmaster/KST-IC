      Sadie is a dog I rescued from Wayside Waifs in 2018. She is a medium sized
      dog, about 50 lbs. She loves every person she's ever met and doesn't
      really care about other dogs. Her favorite activities include going on
      walks, going to the dog park at Shawnee Mission Park, eating and getting
      pets.
